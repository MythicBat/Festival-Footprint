          <strong>Australia's festival heartbeat:</strong>
          From the sun-soaked shores of Byron Bay to the laneways of Melbourne, Australia's music festivals reflect the nation's diverse spirit and geography.  
          Each state nurtures its own rhythm â€” New South Wales and Victoria draw the biggest crowds with internationally renowned events, while Queensland's subtropical vibe fuels open-air beach festivals.  
          In the west, Perth and Fremantle mix indie and surf-rock under blazing sunsets, while the Northern Territory hosts smaller, culture-rich gatherings celebrating Indigenous music and art.  
          Australia's vast landscape â€” from deserts to coastlines â€” shapes not only sound but also timing: spring and summer bring the main festival wave, making the nation groove from September to March.

          <strong>The Soundtrack of a Nation:</strong>  
          Australia's festival stages tell a story of energy and evolution.  
          <strong>Electronic</strong> and <strong>Rock</strong> lead the charts â€” drawing massive, youthful crowds under strobe lights and open skies.  
          <strong>Country</strong> and <strong>Indie</strong> reflect regional roots and emerging artists, while <strong>Folk</strong> and <strong>Blues</strong> preserve the nation's storytelling traditions.  
          Across genres, Australian festivals celebrate both global trends and homegrown sounds â€” proof that creativity thrives in every corner of the continent.

          <strong>When Weather Meets Rhythm:</strong>  
          Australia's diverse climate shapes the festival experience as much as the music itself.  
          Cities like <strong>Melbourne</strong> and <strong>Sydney</strong> enjoy mild temperatures ideal for multi-day outdoor events, while <strong>Darwin</strong> and <strong>Brisbane</strong> favour tropical bursts of celebration before the summer rains.  
          With most festivals thriving between <strong>20-30 Â°C</strong> and low rainfall, organisers and fans alike chase that perfect balance between sunshine, comfort, and sound â€” where the weather becomes part of the music.

        <h2>Festival Seasonality</h2>
        <div id="radial"></div>
        <p class="note">
          Australia's music calendar rises and falls with the seasons â€” a cycle as natural as the weather itself.  
          <strong>Spring and summer</strong> (October-March) mark the peak, filled with major headliners and open-air spectacles.  
          As autumn cools the coasts, festivals move inland with more intimate settings, and by <strong>winter</strong>, the rhythm softens into small-town gigs and indoor showcases.  
          Come September, the volume rises again, ushering in another year of sound, sunshine, and shared experience.

          <strong>Finding the Sweet Spot:</strong>  
          Every city dreams of that perfect festival day â€” warm enough for open-air stages, cool enough to dance, and dry enough for the crowd to stay till the encore.  
          This chart reveals the **climate comfort zones** that define Australia's festival calendar.  
          Capitals like <strong>Melbourne</strong>, <strong>Sydney</strong>, and <strong>Adelaide</strong> strike a near-perfect balance between **20-28 Â°C** with moderate rainfall, aligning with the festival boom from **November to March**.  
          Meanwhile, <strong>Darwin</strong> and <strong>Brisbane</strong> shine earlier in the season before tropical rains arrive.  
          The pattern is clear â€” the rhythm of the weather sets the rhythm of the nation, proving that climate isn't just a backdrop, it's part of the performance.
